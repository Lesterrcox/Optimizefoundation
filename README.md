Optimize is a layer 1 blockchain anyone can understand. It turns real-world things like gold, homes, government bonds into digital assets you can verify, track and trade. Think of it as a global, secure, tamper-proof spreadsheet that you can trust.  Why it matters? Trust is expensive; lawyers, middle men, paperwork, legal rules and delays.
